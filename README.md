README for jHipsterTest
==========================
Welcome to my playground for jHipster. I was introduced to this awesome tool at Vertafore, I am learning how to use it.

Feel free to download and explore on your own!

Terminal commands
-----------------
mvn spring-boot:run (start server backend)<br>
grunt serve (auto deploy frontend changes)<br>

Notes:
Don't touch the files in target (they're auto gen bower files i think)<br>
our touchable files are src/main/webapp/scripts (or assets)<br>

Entities (DB content gen tools)
-------------------------------
yo jhipster:entity
